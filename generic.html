								<p>Picture a little boy sitting in fron of a bulky computer with a Windows Vista operating system using a mechanical keyboard and a traditional mouse (the one with a ball in it), that was me around the age of 10. I was a big fan of computer games at that time. I would play Minesweeper , Need For Speed Hot Pursuit 2 and Mortal Kombat 4 from dusk till dawn.
									As I grew older my fascination with technology (specifically computers) grew too. Often my PC would crash , I would attempt to troubleshoot and fix the issue(s).This usually involved me playing around with the software and when it was hardware I would then take my father's set of screwdrivers and open it up. <br> <br>
									I was not always succesful but even through the failures, I found great joy in what I did. It helped me to learn the basics of hardware and how it was connected. Whilst most of my peers enjoyed playing outside I focused on customizing the computer and learning how to type. By the time I was 13, I could type basic documents like letters and CVs with a relatively fast speed.<br>
									In high school, I took up ICT (Information , communication and technology) as a subject to learn more about technology. It was such a mind-opening experience where I was exposed to a lot of things that I did not know. Outside the classroom , I took a few courses on the side namely ICDL (International Computer Driver's License), CISCO IT essentials , CISCO CCNA (Routing and Switching) and CISCO Cybersecurity.<br> <br>
									I was accepted at the Univeristy Of Limpopo to study Mathematical and Computer Science. The degree equipped me with a lot of in depth knowledge of the world of IT . Upon the completion my degree I engaged myself in a few personal projects to implememnt the skills and knowledge I had obtained throughout my years of schooling.
									
									 </p>
								<p>In all the years I have lived on this earth (short as they may be ), I have realized that learning is a never ending process. I am a student of life and I am eager to learn everyday. It is my hope that you have learnt too .... learnt something about me.</p>
